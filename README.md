# Facebook

This is a simple package I created for my own use to post to facebook. This is not yet ready for general use. I plan to add a lot of other features.

## Install

Via Composer

```
$ composer require developernaren/facebook
```

## Usage
I have made the facebook class into a singleton class because I need only a single instance at a time.
